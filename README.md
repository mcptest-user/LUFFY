# LUFFY Development Repository

> 🚧 **Development Branch** - This is the main development repository for LUFFY (Learning to Reason Under Off‑Policy Guidance)

## About LUFFY

LUFFY is a reinforcement learning framework that bridges the gap between zero-RL and imitation learning by incorporating off-policy reasoning traces into the training process. This repository contains the core implementation and development work.

## 🔧 Development Status

This repository is under active development. Many features are currently being implemented or need refactoring.

## 🚀 Quick Start

⚠️ **Note**: This development version has incomplete implementations. Many features are marked as TODO and need to be completed before production use.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd LUFFY

# Install dependencies
pip install -r luffy/requirements.txt

# Note: Some functionality is incomplete - check TODO list below for details
```
